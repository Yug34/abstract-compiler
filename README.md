## A Rust-based Abstract Compiler that works for multiple languages

Very long-term project, the goal here is to make a single compiler that compiles the source code of multiple different languages into a common AST interoperable with all the languages.

Where will this be useful? In static analysis of codebases that use multiple languages.

There's tons of better way to do things than I'm doing here, just hacking things together and learning on the way. Currently reading [Engineering a Compiler](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/2737838#:~:text=Engineering%20a%20Compiler%20is%20a,to%20build%20a%20modern%20compiler.%E2%80%9D&text=%E2%80%9CA%20wonderful%20introduction%20to%20the,lore%20of%20modern%20compil%2D%20ers.).
