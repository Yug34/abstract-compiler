# C++ Compiler

## Lexer
- Tokenizing strings and chars is done. `cargo test` to test it.
- Math operations and logic (=, ==, +, ++, /, *, -, --, +=, -=, /=, *=) also done.
- Parses classes and functions correctly as well.

## How to run
`cargo run`, and the program should run for the given `example.cpp` file.
